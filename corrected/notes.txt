Usage:

user_input.py contains most of the relevant files to generating and running Serpent code. deck.py and salts.py are used for generating the input and the materials respectively.

#Options at the top of user_input.py to vary how the script is run

At the bottom is this:
debug()
# control_rod_calc()
# feedback_calc()
# full_analy()
# rep_build()

Each of these is a different way of running a script, debug() runs a basic version, control_rod_calc() incorporates variation of control rods, feedback_calc() does the feedback calculations (though this needs looking at), full_analy() does essentially everything, and rep_build() incorporates online reprocessing (I believe this functionality may not be operational at this time, may need to check that).


Things to do:

- Look at fuel enrichment vs keff, issue (currently 0.25% enrichment).

- Simplify branching (runs many scripts, likely posssible with less calculation time)

- Fix plots

- Fix feedback calculations

- Reorganize files for easier usage / allow text file inputs (input initial fuel, refueling fuel, control rod positions, etc.)

- Add New Fuel Types (manipulation of salts.py)

- Incorporate online reprocessing (there are different approaches you can take on this)
